# monogamyst

About
---
Simple script satisfying one's needs of being up to date with his role model's post activity on a certain forum.

Dependencies
---
To run, you will need:
- a running instance of Mozilla Firefox (or compatible, Iceweasel also works) with MozRepl plugin installed and activated
- some Perl modules, see source

TODO
---
- provide espeak support as an alternative to online voice synthesizer
- bypass said online voice synthesizer's constraint of reading only 250 characters (by feeding data in chunks, for example)
- ignore quotes unless there is nothing beside them in the post
- settle on a clever way of dealing with urls
